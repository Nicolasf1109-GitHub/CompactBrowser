# CompactBrowser
A compact browser built with Python, its only 5KB (the browser.py file)

# How to launch
Launch "setup.bat", make sure you have your Python PATH! This will install the following packages:
PyQt5 - Main GUI framework
PyQtWebEngine - Web rendering (used by QWebEngineView)
Once it is done, open "launch.bat". This will open the web browser. (If you want to run it manually, run "browser.py".)
